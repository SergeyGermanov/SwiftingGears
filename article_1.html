            Let’s begin with the question of why I need to learn Swift and
            especially SwiftUI. But why not? When I got my first MacBook
            recently, the first thing I checked was the well-known Xcode IDE.
          </p>
          <p>
            I forgot to mention that in my previous life, I was coding in Visual
            Studio Code and loved it and thought there was nothing better than
            that Microsoft behemoth. Without mentioning VS Code, it wouldn’t be
            fair to continue my post. I could create my own websites, web apps,
            react apps, and even React.Native apps with it. Sometimes I wanted
            to smash my Windows laptop with a bat because nothing worked. Along
            with that, I must tell you that there are also lots of amazing
            plugins that you can install for Visual Studio Code. It is amazing
            how configurable this software is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok. Let’s come back to my journey with Swift and iOS development. So
            I needed to change my nine-year-old laptop to something new and
            everything that had good battery size and productivity was around
            the same price regardless of whether it was an Apple or Windows
            device. Although MacBooks looked better and had a new processor and
            great battery life. So it was obvious to switch to Mac. You cannot
            imagine how difficult it was to get used to MacOS… After some time,
            I started noticing so many great features that just work out of the
            box for Apple without any manual intervention. For example
            screenshots, screen recording, and even the possibility to copy the
            text from any YouTube video when you pause and paste it into your
            IDE.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I installed my Xcode and tried to code my first “Hello World”. It
            appeared to be so easy and intuitive to do. Before I was creating
            JavaScript and React JSX and even tried React.Native, but nothing
            was so easy as to start your first app on an iOS emulator on a
            MacBook. I have decided to give it a try and started to look for a
            nice Swift course to learn the basics. So I looked at Udemy but
            finally found Sean Allen's free courses and started with iOS Dev
            Launchpad (<a
              href="https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/ios-dev-launchpad"
              >https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/ios-dev-launchpad</a
            >). Dev Launchpad is aimed at basic Swift concepts and UIKit. I have
            completed it and felt more comfortable and thanks to Sean Allen I
            learned about the 100 Days of Swift and SwiftUI course. I decided to
            wait a little and continue with Sean’s next course SwiftUI
            Fundamentals (<a
              href="https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/swiftui-fundamentals"
              >https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/swiftui-fundamentals</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            After that and especially when the Appetizer app was completed
            something clicked, and it made me realize that I really like how
            everything works in Xcode and just wanted to continue. I know that I
            should go to Sean’s new courses and just keep progressing, but. And
            it is a big butt BUT I first need to come back to basics and just
            make sure I understand them well. So as my dance teacher always said
            foundation and basic steps are the most important for a good dancer.
            So I followed his advice and started my 100-day journey with
            “Hacking with Swift” (<a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com"
              >https://www.hackingwithswift.com</a
            >) learning SwiftUI from the very beginning baby step at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reality is it is not 100 days, it is 101 days as it starts with
            Day 0 where important questions are raised and the main concepts to
            learn are mentioned. You will get the answer on Why SwiftUI? Or why
            UIKit? What are the most important 5 Core skills you need to master
            to be a good iOS developer? What are the common mistakes when people
            step on the road of learning? And even some extra skills that might
            be helpful in the future are mentioned. Telling all this I should
            say that you shouldn’t skip Day 0. It will help you to see your goal
            better and answer the most important question WHY?
          </p>
          <p>
            Day 1 and Day 2 talk about how to begin and what to do. They start
            from data types such as Int, String, Bool, and Double and what you
            can do with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Day 3 and Day 4 cover complex types such as Array, Set, Dictionary,
            Enum, and when you should use which. The great stuff is that after
            every important concept, you have a short yes-no test to check
            yourself and see if you need to revise any concept once again. I
            really like the way it is done. You can watch a video or you can
            read an article or do both.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next important concept is covered in Day 5 and it is
            “CONDITIONS”. If you code anything you must know that this one is
            very important and you cannot continue if do not understand it.
            Literally, any app has conditions. So if you do not get it, just
            repeat, repeat, and repeat until you get it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you deep dive into another vital concept which is “LOOPS”. We
            do programs to avoid repetitive stuff and loops do it for you. Day 6
            covers it and sums up conditions and loops. Do not forget to check
            your understanding by completing checkpoints and doing tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions, parameters, throwing functions, and returning functions
            are the concepts you should discover for yourself while going
            through days 7 and 8. Make sure you do your checkpoint 4 it will
            make you understand how to write functions and why.
          </p>
          <p>
            Difficult stuff starts on day 9 and it is CLOSURES and passing
            functions into functions. You will need to make sure that it is
            clear in your mind first who to do it and when can we do it. Using
            my previous experience with JS and React I would say it exists there
            too, but in Swift, it is more elegant and easier to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to make sure that Day 10 will stay with you and the memory
            of what a struct is will not leave you. Structs are everywhere in
            iOS development and the faster you understand them the faster you
            start creating your apps. Tests here are getting more difficult and
            you have to pay attention to the smallest detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, I would like to say a big thank you to PAUL HUDSON
            the creator of that course and advise every Swift beginner to start
            with it. You will learn so much stuff and even if you are not a
            beginner in coding just do it as you might be missing some small
            things that would make your life easier. Foundation is the most
            important part of building you as a future professional.
