          Hey there! I'm Sergey, a Developer who thrives on challenges. With
          experience in JavaScript and React.js, I've now set sail on an
          exciting journey into the vibrant world of SwiftUI. Recently, I've

            Many people around me know that I enjoy playing chess to relax and
            exercise my brain. I particularly love playing physical chess
            face-to-face with friends. It allows me to take my time to think,
            discuss various topics, and listen to music. My usual routine
            involves drinking coffee and playing chess...

            Finally after the introduction to many different concepts in SwiftUI
            and practicing them in isolation the time has come to put them into
            full practice through Projects. <br /><br />
            I appreciate the huge amount of work that has been put into the
            development of this course by the author. It is very interesting and
            well-structured. As for me, the first 15 days were a good intro to
            the syntaxes and tools of SwiftUI. If you ever programmed before you
            might even think that it is very easy for you. I would encourage you
            to keep doing it one day at a time. Do not skip or go through
            several lessons a day. Your brain needs some time to get acquainted
            with the new ways of coding. I have found out that Swift has
            borrowed so many concepts from other programming languages and made
            them easier and clearer.<br /><br />
            Although it took me some time to get such concepts as optional,
            unwrapping, if let, and guard...

            It isÂ quiteÂ difficult to force yourself to dedicate yourself toÂ a
            daily activity of learning something new.Â I am not that person who
            starts something and thenÂ justÂ drops it. At least not anymore ðŸ˜‡. I
            have found that I really started enjoying learning how to code in
            Swift for iOS. It is getting more and more interesting every day.
            Although Paul Hudsonâ€™s challenge isÂ amazingÂ there is still something
            I would like to record for myself. Checkpoint solutions are code
            snippets that I would like to keep here in case I decide to update
            themÂ in the future... <a href="article_2.html">read more >></a>

            Letâ€™s begin with the question of why I need to learn Swift and
            especially SwiftUI. But why not? When I got my first MacBook
            recently, the first thing I checked was the well-known Xcode IDE.

            I forgot to mention that in my previous life, I was coding in Visual
            Studio Code and loved it and thought there was nothing better than
            that Microsoft behemoth. Without mentioning VS Code, it wouldnâ€™t be
            fair to continue my post. I could create my own websites, web apps,
            react apps, and even React.Native apps with it. Sometimes I wanted
            to smash my Windows laptop...
