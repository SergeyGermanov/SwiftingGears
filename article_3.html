            Finally after the introduction to many different concepts in SwiftUI
            and practicing them in isolation the time has come to put them into
            full practice through Projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I appreciate the huge amount of work that has been put into the
            development of this course by the author. It is very interesting and
            well-structured. As for me, the first 15 days were a good intro to
            the syntaxes and tools of SwiftUI. If you ever programmed before you
            might even think that it is very easy for you. I would encourage you
            to keep doing it one day at a time. Do not skip or go through
            several lessons a day. Your brain needs some time to get acquainted
            with the new ways of coding. I have found out that Swift has
            borrowed so many concepts from other programming languages and made
            them easier and clearer. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Although it took me some time to get such concepts as optional,
            unwrapping, if let, and guard as they are not present in
            JavaScript. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyway after Day 15 and the Swift review, I was happy to start with
            Projects on SwfitUI. The first one was the“WeSplit” project where we
            created an app for splitting the bill equally to the chosen number
            of people and the percentage of tips included. That so interesting
            for me as a New Zealander to see tips as something important to be
            included in the bill. We don’t have a tipping culture here even
            though sometimes you leave tips if you really like the service and
            everything depends on you how much to tip.
          </p>

          <p>
            The last part of this Project was a challenge to create your app.
            You had to make the converter and choose from time, distance, and
            other units to convert to and from. I decided to take up units of
            Time and created the logic where you put the number into the
            TexField to convert form and pick the input and output units. All
            the calculations are done the second you type the number.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was good that all the concepts and views were discussed and
            practiced on the <strong>“WeSplit”</strong> project as it does
            similar stuff.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Second Project is <strong>“Guess the Flag”</strong> which is
            more interesting as it has a better view and just looks more
            appealing.
          </p>

            <img

          <p>
            It looks very cool and showed in practice how to use modifiers, use
            @State, create alerts, and think about the logic. As the challenge,
            the author asked to update the logic to have only 8 questions asked
            and advise the player on their answer as well as show the score.
          </p>

          <p>
            I liked the challenge on Day 25 which is a Milestone and
            Consolidation II. It was interesting and just took some time first
            to read it and understand what needs to be done as it is a brain
            teaser. But when you got it becomes clear and just need to write the
            logic for it.
          </p>

          <div class="prompt">
            <p>
              Your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges
              players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors. So, very roughly:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock,
              paper, or scissors.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player
              to win or lose.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the
              game.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a
              point.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is
              shown.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to
              choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player
              would need to choose “Scissors”.
            </p>
          </div>

          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img
              src="img/PaperRockScissorsStartEnd.png"
              alt="Header Image of 'PaperRockScissors App' End Game Screen"
            />
            <figcaption>
              <a class="captions" href="img/PaperRockScissorsStartEnd.png"
                >Screenshot of the end game screen for "PaperRockScissors App"
                Project</a
              >
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            So I created the <strong>“RockPaperScissors”</strong> app following
            the hints but didn’t pay too much attention to the look of the
            appexcept that I used system images instead of just text. And I used
            three buttons for the player to tap their answer. After 10 moves the
            game stops and Alert with your score pops up and tells you if you
            are a winner or a loser. And of course, you can restart the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far it is very interesting and challenging sometimes but on a
            level that allows you to learn something new and not drop out of the
            difficulty.
          </p>

          <p>Consistency is the key. Just keep doning it. </p>
